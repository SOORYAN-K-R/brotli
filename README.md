Brotli Executable Repository
This repository contains the Brotli executable for compressing files using the Brotli compression algorithm. Brotli is a modern, general-purpose, lossless compression algorithm optimized for the web.

Features
Compress files (e.g., .png, .txt, .mp4) with high efficiency.
Supports custom output file naming.
Easy to use via command line.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
A working command-line environment (e.g., Windows PowerShell, Command Prompt).
The Brotli executable (brotli.exe) must be present in the repository folder.

Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Ensure the brotli.exe file is in the root folder of the repository.

Usage
To compress a file, run the following command in your terminal:


brotli <input_file> -o <output_file>

Examples:

Compress a PNG file:
brotli kodim07.png -o kodim07.png.br

Compress a text file:
brotli 135-0.txt -o 135-0.br

Notes:
Ensure the input file is in the same directory as the executable or provide the full path to the file.
Brotli creates a compressed version of the file with the .br extension.
